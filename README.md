# Nolan Welch

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nolan â€” a dual Computer Science and Hispanic Linguistics major at UNC-Chapel Hill. My work lives at the intersection of language and logic: I'm passionate about building AI systems that donâ€™t just generate fluent text, but reason with meaning. My current projects explore how structured knowledge representations and sociolinguistic insight can enhance large language models and make them more interpretable, semantically grounded, and truly intelligent.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Background & Research Focus

- **Institution**: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
- **Program**: Honors Carolina | B.S. in Computer Science & Hispanic Linguistics  
- **Current Research**:
  - **Emotion-Driven Code-Switching in Sentiment Analysis** (Honors Thesis): Investigating how sociolinguistic and pragmatic factors affect code-switching behavior and how this information can improve sentiment detection in bilingual NLP systems.
  - **Structured Reasoning for LLMs**: Developing hybrid systems that integrate knowledge graphs (Wikidata, Neo4j) and symbolic inference layers with probabilistic language models â€” aiming to bridge surface form and deep structure in AI understanding.

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Excited About

Iâ€™m passionate about rethinking how AI systems interact with knowledge â€” decoupling language from logic, then deliberately reconnecting them through structured symbolic reasoning and semantically-aware architectures. Whether through code, ontology, or linguistic analysis, I love designing systems that make machine reasoning more transparent and aligned with human meaning.

## ðŸ“« Letâ€™s Connect

I'm always open to collaboration, research ideas, or just thoughtful conversations about language and intelligence.
